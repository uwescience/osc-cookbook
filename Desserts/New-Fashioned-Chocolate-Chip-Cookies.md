"Cookies!")

### Ingredients

8 ounces (227 grams) tahini (1 scant cup)

1 cup (200 grams) sugar

2/3 cup (142 grams) brown sugar

2 large eggs

3 tablespoons cold water

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt

3/4 teaspoon baking soda

2 cups (256 grams) all-purpose flour

12 ounces (340 grams) bittersweet chocolate chunks (about 2 cups)
### Directions
1. Heat the oven to 375° F. Line a couple sheet pans with parchment or
silicone mats.
2. Combine the tahini, sugar, and brown sugar in the bowl of a standing
mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium for a couple
minutes, scraping down with a rubber spatula once or twice. It will be
crumbly, not creamy.
3. Add the eggs, water, and vanilla extract. Continue to mix on medium
for another couple minutes, again scraping every so often. The mixture
will look glossy and fudgy.
4. Add the salt and baking soda. Mix on low just to combine. Add the
flour and mix until almost combined. Now add the chocolate chips and mix
again.
5. Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared sheet pans. Fill
a glass with water, dip your fingers in, then use them to flatten the
cookie dough blobs—figure to a little over 1/2-inch thick. (Don’t worry
if you leave the top of the cookie slightly wet!)
6. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes until the edges are turning golden brown but
the centers are still tender. (If you like slightly underbaked
cookies—you aren’t alone!—lean toward the shorter time. If you like
crispier, keep them in the oven slightly longer.)
7. Let cool on the tray for a few minutes before using a spatula to
transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat the above with the remaining dough.

#### Notes
- Substitute Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour for a GF option.

- These freeze well!
